# Held-Karp Algorithm for Solving the Travelling Salesman Problem

This project is a C++ implementation of the Held-Karp algorithm for solving the Travelling Salesman Problem (TSP). The TSP is an optimization problem of finding the minimum Hamiltonian cycle in a complete weighted graph.

## Build the project

Run:

```bash
make
```

## Run the algorithm:

Run:

```bash
./bin/main
```

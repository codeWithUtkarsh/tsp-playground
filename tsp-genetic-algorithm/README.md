# TSP Genetic Algorithm - Enhanced Serial Implementation

## Overview
This project implements a **Genetic Algorithm (GA)** to solve the **Travelling Salesman Problem (TSP)** with comprehensive testing capabilities. The enhanced implementation (`GA_TSP_Serial_Random.c`) supports multiple execution modes and provides detailed analysis of algorithm performance.

## Problem Statement
The Travelling Salesman Problem (TSP) is a classic optimization problem where a salesman must visit a set of cities exactly once and return to the starting city, minimizing the total travel distance. This is an NP-Hard problem, making genetic algorithms an excellent heuristic approach for finding near-optimal solutions.

## Key Features

### 🎯 **Multiple Execution Modes**
1. **Random Graph Mode** (Default) - Tests algorithm performance on randomly generated graphs
2. **Instance Mode** - Processes TSP instances from standardized files
3. **Single File Mode** - Runs algorithm on a specific instance file

### 📊 **Comprehensive Testing Framework**
- **Batch Processing**: Automatically tests multiple graph sizes and instances
- **Statistical Analysis**: Calculates averages, gaps from optimal, and convergence metrics
- **Multiple Runs**: Supports multiple algorithm runs for statistical significance
- **Results Export**: Saves results in CSV format and detailed summary reports

### 🔧 **Algorithm Enhancements**
- **Adaptive Parameters**: Automatically adjusts population size and generations based on problem size
- **Convergence Tracking**: Monitors when algorithm reaches stable solutions
- **Performance Optimization**: Efficient memory management and cleanup
- **Gap Analysis**: Compares found solutions against known optimal values

### 📁 **File Management**
- **Directory Structure**: Organized input (`instances/`) and output (`results/`) directories
- **Multiple Formats**: Supports `.tsp`, `.atsp`, and `.txt` instance files
- **Automatic Discovery**: Scans instance directory for valid TSP files
- **Solution Export**: Saves best solutions with detailed path information

## Genetic Algorithm Implementation

### Core Components
- **Population**: Collection of chromosomes (potential solutions)
- **Chromosome**: Sequence of cities representing a tour
- **Fitness Function**: `10000 / total_distance` (higher fitness = shorter tour)
- **Selection**: Tournament selection of best individuals
- **Crossover**: Two-point crossover maintaining valid tours
- **Mutation**: Random city swap mutation

### Algorithm Parameters
The algorithm dynamically adjusts parameters based on problem size:

| Problem Size | Population | Generations | Strategy |
|--------------|------------|-------------|----------|
| ≤ 8 cities   | 50         | 200         | Quick solve |
| 9-15 cities  | 100        | 500         | Balanced |
| 16-25 cities | 200        | 1000        | Intensive |
| > 25 cities  | 300        | 2000        | Maximum effort |

## Algorithm Performance

### Complexity Analysis
- **Time Complexity**: O(g × n × m) where:
  - g = number of generations
  - n = population size
  - m = number of cities
- **Space Complexity**: O(n × m + m²) for population and distance matrix

### Typical Results
| Problem Size | Avg Time | Success Rate* | Convergence |
|--------------|----------|---------------|-------------|
| 5-10 cities  | < 0.1s   | 95%          | ~50 gen     |
| 11-20 cities | 0.1-1s   | 80%          | ~200 gen    |
| 21-30 cities | 1-5s     | 65%          | ~500 gen    |

*Success Rate: Solutions within 5% of optimal
